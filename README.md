# Static Web Application Archive

## Summary

This repository contains the files for a simple static website, published as a public GitHub Pages site. The project serves as an archive for a collection of diverse content created to fulfill a specific set of requirements. The assets include a short story, structured JSON data, a vector graphic, and informational text files. The main `index.html` page acts as a central hub, providing access to all the individual files.

## Setup

This project is designed to be hosted on GitHub Pages. No local installation is required to view the live site.

**To deploy your own version:**

1.  Fork this repository.
2.  Go to the repository's **Settings** tab.
3.  In the left sidebar, click on **Pages**.
4.  Under "Build and deployment", select **Deploy from a branch** as the source.
5.  Choose the `main` branch and the `/ (root)` folder, then click **Save**.
6.  Your site will be live at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repository-name>/` in a few minutes.

**To run locally:**

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repository-name>.git
    ```
2.  Navigate into the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd <repository-name>
    ```
3.  Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

## Usage

Once the site is deployed, you can access it via its GitHub Pages URL. The homepage provides a list of all the project's files. Clicking on any link will navigate you to the corresponding file, allowing you to view its content directly in the browser.

## Code Explanation

This project consists of several distinct files, each serving a unique purpose.

*   `index.html`: The main entry point for the website. This HTML5 document lists all the project's assets, providing a brief description and a direct link to each file. It is styled with a clean, dark theme using the "Inter" font from Google Fonts.

*   `ashravan.txt`: A creative writing piece. This text file contains a 300-400 word short story set in Brandon Sanderson's Cosmere universe, imagining the events that follow the character Ashravan's restoration by the Forger, Shai.

*   `dilemma.json`: A JSON file exploring an ethical dilemma for an autonomous vehicle. It models two variations of the "trolley problem," providing a boolean (`swerve`) and a string (`reason`) for the vehicle's decision in each case.

*   `about.md`: A minimalist markdown file that contains a three-word self-description.

*   `pelican.svg`: A Scalable Vector Graphic (SVG) that renders an image of a pelican riding a bicycle. As an XML-based vector image, it can be scaled to any size without loss of quality.

*   `restaurant.json`: This JSON file contains structured data for a restaurant recommendation in Delhi. It includes the city, name, latitude/longitude coordinates, and a suggested dish.

*   `prediction.json`: A JSON data file containing a financial forecast. It provides a predicted value for the US Federal Funds rate for December 2025 and a brief rationale for the prediction.

*   `LICENSE`: The standard MIT License file. This governs the permissions and limitations for the use of the project's code and assets.

*   `uid.txt`: A plain text file containing a unique identifier string, included as per the project requirements.
